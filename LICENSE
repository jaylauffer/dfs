A license is the resposibility of the owner to travel where and when they want for the purposes of their intentions regardless of guardrails, rules and regulations. 
Save as many lives as we may and seek the path of love and forgiveness. Consider others when making these decisions, being mindful that the ocean waits on no one.
There are no terms nor limits, merely the reminder, life is worth living, save as many lives as we may.
Thia license is provided by CMU.
